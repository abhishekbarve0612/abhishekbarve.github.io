  Grocery list - 2
One of the important features of a grocery list is the calculation of the Grand Total. Grand Total is just the sum of the price of all items.
Details

    We have created a small version of a grocery list that consists of some times.

    The price of each is written in a tr element with a data attribute data-ns-test=price.

    There is a Total button your task is to add functionality to this button.

    On click event of this button, the function calcTotal is be executed

    Write a code in calcTotal to calculate the cost of all items and write it inside a row and append it to the table.

    The new row should have two column one with Text Grand Total and other should contain the total price along with a attribute data-ns-test=grandTotal for example <tr><td>Grand Total</td><td data-ns-test="grandTotal">303</td></tr>

    If calcTotal is executed for the second time you have to update the last row with the new grand total price .

    Follow the example given at the end.


Acceptance criteria


    Correct Grand Total.
