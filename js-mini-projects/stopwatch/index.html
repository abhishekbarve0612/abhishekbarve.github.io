  Stopwatch
One of the very important features of javascript is Timing events. There are javaScript functions which after a given time(approx) execute a callback function. We will utilize them to make our own stopwatch.
Details

    This stopwatch will show passed hours min and seconds.
    Format of the output Time string should be HH:MM:SS
    Render 3 buttons start stop pause.
    Stopwatch should start on click event of start button.
    Initially pause and stop button should be disabled and should be functional after stopwatch starts.
    start button should be disabled once the stopwatch starts.
    Initial time should be 00:00:00.
    Pause and stop button have the normal functionality to pause and stop the stopwatch.
    When timer is entering pause state, change text of pause button to continue
    If the stopwatch is continued after a pause, change the text of continue button to pause(like before pause state)
    When stop button is clicked restart the stopwatch (text 00:00:00 and disabled pause, stop buttons and enable start button ).


Acceptance criteria

    Stopwatch should not loose much time(if timer is paused after 0.5 sec then it should not loose that time and continue counting from 0.5 sec).

    disabling of the buttons according to the sequences of the action performed.

    Clearing of the timers/li>
